# lightsOn
Projet for the task from Mariya

It can be compiled without downloading any additional software. The only things to download are maven dependencies.
Also before running this web application, it is necessary to name the future database "lights", create country table and add some values.
Adding values into country table should be the following: id auto incremented, country_code (KZ, RU, CN) and a name for the country (Kazakhstan, Russia, China) respectively. 
After all is set, go to localhost:8082
P.S. Project lacks unit test's and page refreshing after each light status change. Hope you like it!
